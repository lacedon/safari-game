## Safari tycoon

A game where the player manages a safari. The player needs to create ecosystem for the animals, buy new animal, manage the population, build ways to do hiking, tours and hunting.

The main difference with other zoo-tycons:

1. Animals have lifespan and can die
1. Animals should interact with each others and the ecosystem: grass need time to grow -> rabit eats grass -> wolf eats rabit
1. Player need to manage the population in case if one of the steps of the ecosystem's getting in a bad shape
1. Would be nice: Add magical/mythically animals and creatures
1. Would be nice: Add inheritanse, mutations, and evolution
